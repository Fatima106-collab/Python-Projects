# Project 1 : (Title: Customer Insights and Visualization ) : https://github.com/Fatima106-collab/Python-Projects/blob/main/project%201Python.ipyn
* Description
This project explores and analyzes customer data using Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries. It includes advanced data manipulation techniques, the creation of pivot tables, and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, such as identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior based on their location.

* Key Features
    * Data Import and Exploration: Loaded the dataset from a CSV file with encoding handling.
    * Displayed key statistics using .head(), .info(), .tail(), and .describe().
    * Analyzed column values and their distributions.

* Data Transformation and Manipulation:
  *  Created pivot tables to summarize data by Country, City, and Rate using aggregation functions (sum, mean).
  *  Added new columns dynamically, such as Full name.
  *  Grouped data by Country and City to compute statistics.

* Data Cleaning: Handled missing values by dropping rows with null values.
* Data Visualization:
  *  Visualized customer distribution by City and Country using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  *  Created bar plots for top 10 cities by customer count.
  *  Enhanced visualizations with custom titles, labels, and color palettes.
* Technologies Used
  * Python
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn

* Dataset
Customers.csv: Contains customer information, including FirstName, LastName, City, Country, and Rate.

* Visual Outputs:
Pivot table summarizing customer rates by Country and City.
Bar charts representing customer distribution by cities and countries.
Top 10 cities visualized using Seaborn for better insights
